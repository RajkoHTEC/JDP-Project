# JDP-Project

App consist of 2 Activities: MainActivity and ForResult Activity

In the main activity, I have tested:
- Some of extern intents: ACTION_SEND (email) , ACTION_DIAL(), ACTION_PICK (from contacts)
- Handling if there is no such activity 
- Intern intents with primary extras, Bundles & Parcels
- Creating Parcel
- Handling on Activity Result
